# Unveiling the Evolution of Horror TV Series Ratings: A Dive into IMDb Trends

In this project, we explore how IMDb ratings for horror TV Series change as
shows progress through their seasons. Our analyses delve into the trends of
ratings over time, comparing different TV Series in the Horror Genre.

We explore the volume of Ratings fluctuating with each season, providing
insights on these series' popularity and viewer engagement. This analysis
is valuable for fans, critics, and industry professionals looking to understand
how the reception of horror TV series develops over time. By highlighting these
trends, we offer actionable information to help producers decide
about TV series production and viewer engagement strategies.

## Research question
*Do Horror TV series episodes tend to receive higher or lower IMDb ratings as
a show progresses through its seasons?*

## Research Method
The research method includes several steps. First, a descriptive
statistics analysis is performed. This is crucial as it gives simple
insights into the data for any patterns and/or trends. It is helpful for
the research as it allows us to have a quick overview of how the ratings
change over the seasons of TV series. We will calculate the average
ratings per season.

Second, our approach combines regression analysis to model the relationship
between ratings and seasons with time series analysis to observe trends and
patterns over time. This integrated methodology provides a comprehensive view
of how the reception of horror TV series develops, offering valuable insights
for fans, critics, and industry professionals. Understanding these trends can
guide decisions related to TV series production and viewer engagement
strategies.

### Analysis Overview

1. **Regression Analysis**: We use regression techniques to model and predict
how ratings vary with each new season of horror TV series.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: We apply time series methods to examine temporal
trends and patterns in the ratings over time, highlighting how viewer
engagement changes with the progression of seasons.
