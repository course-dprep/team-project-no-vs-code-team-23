# ---- Key metrics from Regression Analysis ----
#Coefficient for Season Number: 0.007999 
#Standard Error: 0.004079 
#t value: 1.961 
#p-value for Season Number Coefficient: 0.0499 
#R-squared: 0.0005603 
#Adjusted R-squared: 0.0004146 

# ---- Summary of our findings ----
#The effect of seasonNumber on averageRating is statistically significant, but the effect size is extremely small (an increase of 0.008 per season).
#The model's predictive power is very low (R-squared is close to zero), meaning that seasonNumber does not explain much of the variance in IMDb ratings.
#Although there's a small positive trend, it may not be practically meaningful.
# Description: This visualization provides an overview of how IMDb ratings vary over seasons for each horror series.

# This will give you a list of series where the season number significantly affects the ratings.

# ---- Summary of the lisat with models ----
#Series with negative coefficients (e.g., tt1844624, tt3743822, tt2761354) show a decline in ratings as seasons progress.
#Series with positive coefficients (e.g., tt1105711, tt0094578) show an increase in ratings over their seasons.



# ---- Time Series Analysis ----
# Aggregating the data by season

# Aggregate across all series to see general trends

  group_by(seasonNumber) %>%
  summarize(avg_season_rating = mean(avg_season_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the general trend over seasons

  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average IMDb Ratings Over Seasons (All Series)",
    x = "Season Number",
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

#---- Summary of Results ----
#There doesnâ€™t appear to be a smooth increasing or decreasing trend over seasons. Instead, the ratings fluctuate, which could indicate that ratings are affected by multiple factors other than just the progression of seasons.
#Since this plot aggregates ratings across all series, it might obscure series-specific patterns. Certain series might have consistently increasing or decreasing trends that are averaged out in this plot.
#The sharp spikes and drops could result from certain series having fewer seasons or episodes, thus disproportionately influencing the average for some seasons.


# ---- Smoothing the plot to focus on the general trend without sharp fluctuations ----
ggplot(aggregated_ratings, aes(x = seasonNumber, y = avg_season_rating)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Add a smoothing line
  labs(
    title = "Smoothed Average IMDb Ratings Over Seasons",
    x = "Season Number",
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggsave("gen/smoothed_ratings_plot.pdf")


#---- Results of Smoothing the plot ----
#Non-Linear Trend: The smoothed line indicates a non-linear relationship between season number and average rating. There is no simple upward or downward trend but rather a fluctuating pattern.
#Outlier Seasons: Some seasons show sharp changes in ratings, suggesting that particular series might be significantly better or worse in those seasons.


# ---- Further Data Enrichment ----
# Description: This step explores whether the number of words in the title of episodes or series has any correlation with IMDb ratings.
# Text Analysis: Extract Word Count of Titles to See Correlation with Ratings
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(title_word_count = str_count(primaryTitle, "\\w+"))

# Correlation Between Title Word Count and Ratings
correlation_analysis <- lm(averageRating ~ title_word_count, data = clean_data)
summary(correlation_analysis)

# Visualization of Correlation
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = title_word_count, y = averageRating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Title Word Count and IMDb Ratings",
    x = "Word Count in Title",
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
# ---- Summary of Results ----
#There is a statistically significant positive relationship between the number of words in a title and IMDb ratings, but the effect size is minimal. In practical terms, for each additional word in a title, the average rating increases slightly by 0.017.
#However, the low R-squared value indicates that title_word_count alone is not a strong predictor of averageRating. Most of the variation in ratings is explained by other factors not included in this simple model.
